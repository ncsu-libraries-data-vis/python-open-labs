    "## Setup\n",
    "With this Google Colaboratory (Colab) notebook open, click the \"Copy to Drive\" button that appears in the menu bar. The notebook will then be attached to your own user account, so you can edit it in any way you like -- you can even take notes directly in the notebook.\n",

    "## Instructors\n",
    "- Walt Gurley\n",
    "- Claire Cahoon\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Labs agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Guided activity**: One of the instructors will share their screen to work through the guided activity and teach concepts along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   **Open lab time**: After the guided portion of the Open Lab, the rest of the time is for you to ask questions, work collaboratively, or have self-guided practice time. You will have access to instructors and peers for questions and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakout rooms will be available if you would like to work in small groups. If you have trouble joining a room, ask in the chat to be moved into a room.\n",

    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "Series announcement: In this lab we will cover common exploratory analysis methods such as calculating summary statistics and aggregating and grouping data using pandas. \n",

    "- TODO\n",
    "- Exploratory analysis\n",
    "- Counts by nationality or gender\n",
    "- Comparing measurements\n",
    "- Dates over time (add in factors like nationality or gender)\n",

    "## Questions during the workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "Please feel free to ask questions throughout the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a second instructor who will available during the workshop. They will answer as able, and will collect questions with answers that might help everyone to be answered at the end of the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open lab time is when you will be able to ask more questions and work together on the exercises."

    "### Learning resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html) - a free, online version of Jake VanderPlas' introduction to data science with Python, includes a chapter on data manipulation with pandas.\n",
    "- [Python Programming for Data Science](https://www.tomasbeuzen.com/python-programming-for-data-science/README.html) - a website providing a great overview of conducting data science with Python including pandas.\n",
    "- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) contains a lot of different tutorials at different levels\n",
    "- [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.lynda.com/Python-training-tutorials/415-0.html) is free with NC State accounts and contains several video series for learning Python\n",

    "\n",
    "The [Pandas website](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [online documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) are useful resources, and of course the indispensible [Stack Overflow has a \"pandas\" tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas).  There is also a (much younger, much smaller) [sister site dedicated to Data Science questions that has a \"pandas\" tag](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pandas) too."

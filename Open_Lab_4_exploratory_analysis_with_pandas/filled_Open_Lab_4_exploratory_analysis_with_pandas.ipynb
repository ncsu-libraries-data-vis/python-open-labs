    "## Setup\n",
    "With this Google Colaboratory (Colab) notebook open, click the \"Copy to Drive\" button that appears in the menu bar. The notebook will then be attached to your own user account, so you can edit it in any way you like -- you can even take notes directly in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructors\n",
    "- Walt Gurley\n",
    "- Claire Cahoon\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Labs agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   **Guided activity**: One of the instructors will share their screen to work through the guided activity and teach concepts along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   **Open lab time**: After the guided portion of the Open Lab, the rest of the time is for you to ask questions, work collaboratively, or have self-guided practice time. You will have access to instructors and peers for questions and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakout rooms will be available if you would like to work in small groups. If you have trouble joining a room, ask in the chat to be moved into a room.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the workshop today, we hope you'll by able to explore datasets using aggregation methods and grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Today's Topics\n",
    "- Exploratory analysis\n",
    "- Unique values\n",
    "- Value counts\n",
    "- Minimum, maximum, and average\n",
    "- Grouping using `groupby()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions during the workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "Please feel free to ask questions throughout the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a second instructor who will available during the workshop. They will answer as able, and will collect questions with answers that might help everyone to be answered at the end of the workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The open lab time is when you will be able to ask more questions and work together on the exercises."

    "## Using Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colaboratory\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to write and run Python code in an interactive way. They're quickly becoming a standard way of putting together data, code, and written explanations or visualizations into a single document and sharing that. There are a lot of ways that you can run Jupyter notebooks, including just locally on your computer, but we've decided to use Google's Colaboratory notebook platform for this workshop.  Colaboratory is “a Google research project created to help disseminate machine learning education and research.”  If you would like to know more about Colaboratory in general, you can visit the [Welcome Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Google Colaboratory platform allows us to focus on learning and writing Python in the workshop rather than on setting up Python, which can sometimes take a bit of extra work depending on platforms, operating systems, and other installed applications. If you'd like to install a Python distribution locally, though, we're happy to help. Feel free to [get help from our graduate consultants](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/dxl) or [schedule an appointment with Libraries staff](https://go.ncsu.edu/dvs-request)."

    "### Exploratory analysis of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "After observing and cleaning our dataset, it is now easier to conduct analyses on our data. We will conduct some numerical and visual analyses that will help us explore questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many unique species have been identified in the data set?\n",
    "- Which species are struck the most?\n",
    "- How have number of strikes changed over time?\n",

    "- How frequently are land-based animals involved?\n",

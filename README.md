# Python Open Labs

These materials provide an introduction to core concepts for working with data in Python using the pandas data analysis library and were originally used for instructor-led open lab sessions. Each open lab consisted of a guided activity covering specific concepts followed by extended open time for self-guided practice using datasets and activities provided by the instructors. During open time participants had access to instructors and peers for questions and support.

## Open Lab 1: Reading, exploring, and writing data with Pandas

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ncsu-libraries-data-vis/python-open-labs/blob/main/Open_Lab_1_reading_exploring_and_writing_data_with_pandas/Open_Lab_1_reading_exploring_and_writing_data_with_pandas.ipynb)

In this lab we will cover an introduction to the Pandas library, including methods for reading, exploring, and writing various data formats such as tab-delimited files, Excel files, and JSON files with Pandas.

This series provides an introduction to core concepts for working with data in Python using the Pandas data analysis library and an opportunity to apply these concepts in an open, supported environment. In this lab we will cover basic pandas methods for loading, combining, and preparing different types of datasets for analyses with pandas. The format of each open lab consists of a guided activity covering specific concepts followed by extended open time for self-guided practice using datasets and activities provided by the instructors. During this open time participants will have access to instructors and peers for questions and support.

These materials were developed by Claire Cahoon and Walt Gurley at the NC State University Libraries, adapted from previous workshop materials by Scott Bailey and Simon Wiles, of Stanford Libraries.

The data used in this workshop consist of modified subsets of the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) research datasets representing all of the works and artists that have been accessioned into MoMAâ€™s collection and cataloged in their database. The original datasets were accessed via the [MoMA collection GitHub repository](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection) ![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4408594.svg).

The datasets used in these materials are accessible in the [NC State University Libraries Data & Visualization Teaching Datasets repository](https://github.com/ncsu-libraries-data-vis/teaching-datasets/tree/main/moma_data).

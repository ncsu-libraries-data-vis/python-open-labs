# Python Open Labs Spring 2021

These materials provide an introduction to core concepts for working with data in Python using the pandas data analysis library and were originally used for instructor-led open lab sessions. Each open lab consisted of a guided activity covering specific concepts followed by extended open time for self-guided practice using datasets and activities provided by the instructors. During open time participants had access to instructors and peers for questions and support.

## Python Open Labs: Reading, exploring, and writing data with Pandas

In this lab we will cover an introduction to the Pandas library, including methods for reading, exploring, and writing various data formats such as tab-delimited files, Excel files, and JSON files with Pandas. The format of each open lab consists of a guided activity covering specific concepts followed by extended open time for self-guided practice using datasets and activities provided by the instructors. During this open time participants will have access to instructors and peers for questions and support.

In this lab we will cover common methods for cleaning and preparing datasets for analyses with Pandas such as filtering, aggregation, and joins. The format of each open lab consists of a guided activity covering specific concepts followed by extended open time for self-guided practice using datasets and activities provided by the instructors. During this open time participants will have access to instructors and peers for questions and support.
